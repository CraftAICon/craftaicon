              While the latest AI models demonstrate their ability to generate code, the community has quickly split
              into two camps. One camp wants to save time and generate code because tasks with the help of the AI take
              significantly less time, which can lead to increased productivity. Others are more focused on code
              reliability, security, and expressed concerns about the risk of information leakage. We will review these
              aspects and answer questions for ourselves:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Is AI-generated code safe, and can it be securely used in product development or for the purpose of
                creating code for your clients?
              </li>
              <li>How to assess the risk size due to data leakage when assigning tasks to artificial intelligence?</li>
              <li>What kind of support can AI solutions provide to ensure secure programming?</li>
              <li>
                And most importantly - what daily actions should be taken to ensure that code in the production
                environment is secure, regardless of its source.

                (2019). As a student, he carried out research in the area of signal processing in neurological diseases,
                at INESC TEC. Since 2019, he has worked as a Data Scientist at
                <a target="_blank" href="https://nilg.ai/">NILG.AI</a> (currently Lead Data Scientist), where he
                supports companies to use artificial intelligence as part of their business strategy. He has also been
                part of the Lead Team of Data Science for Social Good Portugal (DSSG PT) since October 2019, an

            AI is the only technology that can create highly adaptable and ever-improving businesses. In this talk, we
            will discuss the three tribes of AI: Model-centric AI, Data-centric AI, Business-centric AI. What
            distinguishes them? What is our recommended approach to build AI projects? Covering examples of use cases
            with different approaches according to these tribes

            Recent advances in next-generation sequencing and other types of high-throughput technologies allowed for
            various types of biological and biomedical data to be collected and analyzed with the focus on machine
            learning predictive modeling. In this presentation, I will give an overview of available data and current
            challenges in Life Sciences, and concentrate on how machine learning methods are typically applied for cell
            biology and clinical diagnostics.
